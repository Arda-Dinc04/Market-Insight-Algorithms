SUMMARY
     F.R.E.D.'s main goal is to pull a stocks data after it is identified as potentially profitbale from P.R.I.A., and organize it into our own custom database that is categorized and more easily read by D.A.V.E. who will analyze the data and tell us whether or not the stock is a good opportunity for a short sell. F.R.E.D. 1.0 accomplishes this by creating a csv based database, although future generations of F.R.E.D. will use SQL databases instead to increase efficiency and add chart based technical data into the database. Currently F.R.E.D. is coded in such a way that the algorithm uses a lot of API calls through yahoo finance, nearly one call per piece of data. This is an inefficient method, but it avoids having to import one larger database with one API call, and then sort through that database to get the information we want, to then build our own database. If the amount of API calls becomes a problem as this code scales up, this part of the program will have to change. 

CURRENT DATA MANAGED AND STORED BY F.R.E.D.
